        Over the past few months I've had the freedom to work on technology projects simply for the fun of it. I created an LED display to show local real-time
        bus departures and London Underground information, which I then adapted for use by Greenpeace at the Glastonbury Festival 2015. You can read about that
        project <a href="http://showmethespoon.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/leap-and-net-will-appear.html">here</a>. Despite my protestations in that
        blog post defending Java I <i>have</i> since re-written part of the application in C, and discovered how aesthetically pleasing JNI isn't.

        I worked on an interactive audio-visual experience for Greenpeace's field at Glastonbury (blog post to follow when I finally get the photos).
        I also used a Raspberry Pi to control our central heating system from a tablet, and another for an automated rainwater collection and irrigation
        system for our vegetable plot (the latter is on hold until our ancient washing machine finally breaks so I can harvest it for parts).

        Some of these projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/MisterGrimalkin">GitHub page</a>.
