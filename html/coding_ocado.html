    <h1>Ocado Technology (2010 - 2015)</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="coder.html" target="_self">BACK</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        I worked as a Software Engineer on a variety of projects, mainly web-based applications for in-house staff. I designed and built several systems
        from design to post-deployment support, both alone and in teams ranging from two to ten people. My particular speciality was UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked in Java and SQL, using Tomcat and GlassFish servers on Linux VMs as well as Cloud-based servers.
        I gained experience of database design, iterative user interface development,
        XML and JSON messaging, HTTP services, dependency injection frameworks, Scrum Agile development practice and Test Driven Development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked on several large Java applications with GXT front-ends, a cross-area testing team prior to the opening of Ocado's second Customer
        Fulfillment Centre, and a major replatforming project using cloud-based micro-services prior to the company's first business-to-business venture.
        I provided technical support to users at Ocado and Morrisons, and liaised with other external companies. I received training in computer
        security and anti-competition legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also contributed to some in-house frameworks we developed for our applications, and which were subsequently used by other teams. One of them is now
        open source, and I still use it my own projects.
    </p>

    <h2>Ocado Council Representative for Technology</h2>
    <p>
        From 2013 I was a representative for the Technology department on the business's employee council, representing the concerns of my constituents to the highest
        levels of management. I received ACAS training for disciplinary and grievance resolution, and learned techniques for effective meeting facilitation,
        discussion and decision making. I also gained quite a reputation for the regular entertaining update communications I sent out to my constituents, and I like
        to think I had some influence on the dramatic increase in constituent participation in Council affairs that occurred during my tenure.
