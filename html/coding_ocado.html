        <h1>Ocado Technology (2010 - 2015)</h1>

        <p>
            <a href="http://www.ocado.com">Ocado</a> is an online supermarket based just outside London. The company has
            always written most of its IT systems in-house, and the technology department has grown to become almost
            a <a href="http://www.ocadotechnology.com/">separate company</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked as a Software Engineer on a variety of projects, mainly web-based applications for in-house staff.
            I designed and built several systems from concept to post-deployment support,
            both alone and in teams ranging from two to ten people.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked in Java and SQL, using Tomcat and GlassFish servers on Linux VMs as well as Cloud-based servers.
            I gained experience of database design, iterative user interface development,
            XML and JSON messaging, HTTP services, dependency injection frameworks, Scrum Agile development practice and Test Driven Development.
            I became a Clean Coder of the 'Uncle Bob' variety.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked on several large Java applications with GXT front-ends, a cross-area testing team prior to the opening of Ocado's second Customer
            Fulfillment Centre, and a major replatforming project using cloud-based micro-services prior to the company's first
            international business-to-business venture.
            I provided technical support to users at Ocado and Morrisons, and liaised with other external companies. I received training in computer
            security and anti-competition legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also contributed to some in-house frameworks we developed for our applications, and which were subsequently used by other teams. One of them is now
            open source, and I still use it my own projects.
        </p>

        <h1>Ocado Council Representative for Technology</h1>
        <p>
            From 2013 I was a representative for the Technology department on the business's employee council, representing the concerns of my constituents to the highest
            levels of management. I received ACAS training for disciplinary and grievance resolution, and learned techniques for effective meeting facilitation,
            discussion and decision making. I also gained quite a reputation for the regular entertaining update communications I sent out to my constituents, and I like
            to think I had some influence on the dramatic increase in constituent participation in Council affairs that occurred during my tenure.
