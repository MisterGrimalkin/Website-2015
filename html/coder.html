    <h1>Philosophy</h1>
    <p>
        I've had an interest in computers since I was very young, when computers were largely irrelevant (or at least invisible) to the everyday person
        in the street. Now, like most people in our society, I carry around a computer in my pocket that is significantly more powerful than the
        first desktop machine I ever owned. Computers have emerged from the purview of scientists and big businesses and become indispensably mainstream.
        The technology might still be a bit more 'Red Dwarf' than it is 'Star Trek' but personal computers are, finally, more useful than they are frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
        I strongly believe that coding should be taught as a basic skill on par with numeracy and literacy, and I'm very happy to see innovations such as the
        Raspberry Pi and the Arduino now so widely available. They also let you easily control low-level hardware, which is great fun for all ages.
    </p>
    <p>
        From a coding perspective I'm a firm follower of lightweight micro-service architecture, test-driven development and responsive intuitive user interfaces.
        I'm reasonably happy to skip around the first two of those principles if absolutely necessary. Pragmatism generally outweighs idealism if not morality.

	<h1>Experience</h1>

    <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
    <p>
        Over the past few months I've had the freedom to work on technology projects simply for the fun of it. I created an LED display to show local real-time
        bus departures and London Underground information, which I then adapted for use by Greenpeace at the Glastonbury Festival 2015. You can read about that
        project <a href="http://showmethespoon.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/leap-and-net-will-appear.html">here</a>. Despite my protestations in that
        blog post defending Java I <i>have</i> since re-written part of the application in C, and discovered how aesthetically pleasing JNI isn't.
    </p>

        <br>Better start running if you're headed for Harringay!
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked on an interactive audio-visual experience for Greenpeace's field at Glastonbury (blog post to follow when I finally get the photos).
        I also used a Raspberry Pi to control our central heating system from a tablet, and another for an automated rainwater collection and irrigation
        system for our vegetable plot (the latter is on hold until our ancient washing machine finally breaks so I can harvest it for parts).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of these projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/MisterGrimalkin">GitHub page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Ocado Technology (2010 - 2015)</h2>
    <p>
        I worked as a Software Engineer on a variety of projects, mainly web-based applications for in-house staff. I designed and built several systems
        from design to post-deployment support, both alone and in teams ranging from two to ten people. My particular speciality was UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked in Java and SQL, using Tomcat and GlassFish servers on Linux VMs as well as Cloud-based servers.
        I gained experience of database design, iterative user interface development,
        XML and JSON messaging, HTTP services, dependency injection frameworks, Scrum Agile development practice and Test Driven Development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I worked on several large Java applications with GXT front-ends, a cross-area testing team prior to the opening of Ocado's second Customer
        Fulfillment Centre, and a major replatforming project using cloud-based micro-services prior to the company's first business-to-business venture.
        I provided technical support to users at Ocado and Morrisons, and liaised with other external companies. I received training in computer
        security and anti-competition legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also contributed to some in-house frameworks we developed for our applications, and which were subsequently used by other teams. One of them is now
        open source, and I still use it my own projects.
    </p>

    <h2>Ocado Council Representative for Technology</h2>
    <p>
        From 2013 I was a representative for the Technology department on the business's employee council, representing the concerns of my constituents to the highest
        levels of management. I received ACAS training for disciplinary and grievance resolution, and learned techniques for effective meeting facilitation,
        discussion and decision making. I also gained quite a reputation for the regular entertaining update communications I sent out to my constituents, and I like
        to think I had some influence on the dramatic increase in constituent participation in Council affairs that occurred during my tenure.
    </p>

    <h2>Hockley Street Studios (2002 - 2010)</h2>
    <p>
        I was a partner in this small music business and co-ran it for many years. I was involved with the raising of the initial capital, physically (very
        physically) involved with the interior fit-out of the four-floor premises, and had responsibility for managing the company's finances. I gained
        enormous experience of customer relations, with a customer base that spanned a swathe of demographics and musical backgrounds. I've become quite skilled
        at adapting my spoken and written language to suit my target audience, and I'm well good at chatting with all sorts of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote a bespoke Visual Basic application to manage the operational aspects of the business, which is still in use.
        I designed all promotional material used during my time there.
        I liaised with the local council, magazines, radio stations and other bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following the refit of our recording studio in 2006 I became the resident producer and session keyboardist, and worked with a great many local
        bands and artists from a range of musical styles. I worked effectively with experienced bands and complete novices. I worked mainly in Cubase, but have
        since switched platforms and now use Logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        I left the business when I moved to London to pursue other interests.
    </p>

    <h2>Monosystems Ltd. (1998 - 2000)</h2>
    <p>
        Although my job title was variable and largely meaningless, my responsibilities included setting up and managing the IT infrastructure for this
        interior fit-out company and building several bespoke Visual Basic applications for project estimation and administration.
    </p>
    <p>
        I stayed on to provide technical support after I started my degree in 1999. My favourite call ran something like this:<br>
        ME: What's the problem? THEM: The sever's down! ME: Are you sure it's plugged in? THEM: Yes, all the cables are plugged in but the lights aren't on.
        ME: Have you tried pressing the power button? THEM: Hold on... Yes, it's still not coming on. ME: Hmmm... THEM: Er, we've had a leak and the server's
        sitting in a pool of water, do you think that might have something to do with it? ME: We probably shouldn't rule that out.
    </p>


    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>
        I received a BSc. in Computer Science (2:1) from the University of Warwick. My final year project was a Java implementation of Dijkstra's Guarded
        Command Language, to produce mathematically-verifiable Java algorithms using Weakest Precondition.
    </p>
    <p>
        I attended Handsworth Grammar School for A-Levels in: Computing (A), Maths (A), Physics (A), General Studies (A), Further Maths (B)
        and a Special Paper in Physics (2); and GCSEs in: Maths (A*), English (A*), English Literature (A*), French (A*), Physics (A*), Chemistry (A*),
        Biology (A), Information Technology (A), Geography (A) and Music (B).
    </p>
    <p>
        During my GCSEs I did a two-week work experience with a development team at ICL, where I first learned SQL and caffeine abuse.
    </p>

    <h1>Technologies</h1>
    <p>
        Here is a bewilderingly TLA-heavy list of some of the technologies I have experience with: GXT, GWT, BootStrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for UIs;
        Guice, Gin and Spring for dependency management and AOP;
        Maven, Ant and Bash for building and deployment; Hibernate, Toad and PL/SQL for database work; Jersey for HTTP services; JUnit and Cobertura for unit and
        behavioral tests;
        servers including Tomcat and GlassFish; Amazon Cloud Services; Akka for scalability; Git, Mercurial and Subversion for code versioning; JMS, XML and JSON.
        I am a very fast learner when it comes to new technologies, because I had to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am proficient with PhotoShop and Excel. I've used NetBeans and Eclipse IDEs but more recently settled on IntelliJ IDEA.
        I prefer Linux and Android for everyday use, Mac OS-X for music production and Windows when I absolutely have to.
