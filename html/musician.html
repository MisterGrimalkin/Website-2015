            I am available for session work, live or studio, and I'm always interested in working with interesting musicians. You can find me on

            I'm currently working with singer/songwriter

        <h1>Past</h1>
        <p>
            I've been around music my entire life. My first stage performance was on drums, aged eight,
            but I was quickly seduced by the piano and the synthesizer. I was the 'odd kid' in the heavily
            classically-oriented music department at school, because I played in bands and wrote my own music.
            My classical training ended after my A-levels.
            I didn't study music at university, but I carried on playing keyboards in a pop/rock band and couple of metal bands
            while I was a student. I even, once, played a gig wearing corpse-paint. Only once. Only ever once.
        </p>
        <p>
            After university I ran a music rehearsal and recording studio in Birmingham with my brother Martyn.
            I was the resident engineer/producer and occasional session keyboardist for various
            local acts who recorded with us over the years. <a href="http://www.hockleystreetstudios.co.uk">Hockley Street Studios</a> is
            still going, though I parted ways with the business when I moved to London in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
            I met many fantastic musicians over the eight years I was at Hockley Street, and had the pleasure of
            jamming and performing with a lot of them. With so many influences my playing developed and I began to find my own style.
            I learned a lot about music theory, and even got into jazz (which is a lot more fun to play than to listen to).
            I played and recorded extensively with electronica/ska band Circadia and jazz/funk/psychedelic
            band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snootybobs">Snooty Bobs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since moving to London I've played with jazz/soul band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soulmaze">Soulmaze</a>, cabaret jazz
            band Winnet, a couple of function bands (no!) and, of course, the ska/punk covers super-group-extraordinaire
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lessthanareelbiggoldfishfinger">Less Than A Real Big Gold Fish Finger</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recently produced an EP for ska band
            <a href="https://besharp.bandcamp.com/album/we-did-this-to-ourselves">Call Me Malcolm</a>,
            and produced a few soundtrack projects for <a href="http://www.twotwentytwomusic.com/">Two Twenty Two Music</a>.
