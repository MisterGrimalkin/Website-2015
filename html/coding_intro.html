        I've had an interest in computers since I was very young, when computers were largely irrelevant (or at least invisible) to the everyday person
        in the street. Now, like most people in our society, I carry around a computer in my pocket that is significantly more powerful than the
        first desktop machine I ever owned. Computers have emerged from the purview of scientists and big businesses and become indispensably mainstream.
        The technology might still be a bit more 'Red Dwarf' than it is 'Star Trek' but personal computers are, finally, more useful than they are frustrating.

        I strongly believe that coding should be taught as a basic skill on par with numeracy and literacy, and I'm very happy to see innovations such as the
        Raspberry Pi and the Arduino now so widely available. They also let you easily control low-level hardware, which is great fun for all ages.

        From a coding perspective I'm a firm follower of lightweight micro-service architecture, test-driven development and responsive intuitive user interfaces.
        I'm reasonably happy to skip around the first two of those principles if absolutely necessary. Pragmatism generally outweighs idealism if not morality.
