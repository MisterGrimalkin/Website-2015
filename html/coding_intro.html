        <h1>Coding Philosophy</h1>

        <p>
            I've had an interest in computers since I was very young, when computers were largely irrelevant (or at least invisible) to the everyday person
            in the street. Now, like most people in the West, I carry around a computer in my pocket that is significantly more powerful than the
            first desktop machine I ever owned. Computers have emerged from the purview of scientists and big businesses and become indispensably mainstream.
            The technology might still be a bit more 'Red Dwarf' than it is 'Star Trek' but personal computers are, finally, more useful than they are frustrating.

            I believe software should be so intuitive as to be virtually transparent to the user. While working at Ocado I gained a reputation for creating
            aesthetic and streamlined user interfaces, and I was often given free reign to design UIs as I saw fit. Code should be clean, readable and
            easily maintainable. I advocate Test Driven Development where possible, and am in favour of distributed micro-service software architecture.

            Recently I've made extensive use of Raspberry Pis - an excellent innovation - to control custom hardware. This is another step in making
            computers useful to daily life, and also tremendous fun.
