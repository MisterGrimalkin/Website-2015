    <h1>Current Projects</h1>

    <p>
        I am currently taking a sabbatical from day-job world to give myself time to focus on
        music and other projects. I'm writing and recording my own music, which I will gradually
        release into the wild when I'm happy with it.

        I recently played on a three-track EP for singer/songwriter
        <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/697227558/lewis-foreman-new-ep-get-this-man-heard">Lewis Foreman</a>
        and will be playing in his live band to support the release.

        I'm playing with singer/songwriter <a href="https://soundcloud.com/angie-music">Angie Porter</a>
        on her live project.

        I often gig with jazz/funk/psychedelic band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snootybobs">Snooty Bobs</a>
        and jazz/soul band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soulmaze">Soulmaze</a>.
