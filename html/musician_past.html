    <h1>Musical History</h1>
<p>
    I've been around music my entire life. My first stage performance was on drums, aged eight,
    but I was quickly seduced by the piano and the synthesizer. I was the 'odd kid' in the heavily
    classically-oriented music department at school, because I played in bands and wrote my own music.
    My classical training ended after my A-levels.
    I didn't study music at university, but I carried on playing keyboards in a pop/rock band and couple of metal bands
    while I was a student. I even, once, played a gig wearing corpse-paint. Only once. Only ever once.
</p>
<p>
    After university I ran a music rehearsal and recording studio in Birmingham with my brother Martyn.
    I was the resident engineer/producer and occasional session keyboardist for various
    local acts who recorded with us over the years. <a href="http://www.hockleystreetstudios.co.uk">Hockley Street Studios</a> is
    still going, though I parted ways with the business when I moved to London in 2010.
</p>
<p>
    I met many fantastic musicians over the eight years I was at Hockley Street, and had the pleasure of
    jamming and performing with a lot of them. With so many influences my playing developed and I began to find my own style.
    I played and recorded extensively with electronica/ska band Circadia and jazz/funk/psychedelic
    band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snootybobs">Snooty Bobs</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Since moving to London I've played with jazz/soul band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soulmaze">Soulmaze</a>, cabaret jazz
    band Winnet, a couple of function bands (no!) and, of course, the ska/punk covers super-group-extraordinaire
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lessthanareelbiggoldfishfinger">Less Than A Real Big Gold Fish Finger</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I recently produced an EP for ska band
    <a href="https://besharp.bandcamp.com/album/we-did-this-to-ourselves">Call Me Malcolm</a>,
    and produced a few soundtrack projects for <a href="http://www.twotwentytwomusic.com/">Two Twenty Two Music</a>.
