        Although my job title was variable and largely meaningless, my responsibilities included setting up and managing the IT infrastructure for this
        interior fit-out company and building several bespoke Visual Basic applications for project estimation and administration.

        I stayed on to provide technical support after I started my degree in 1999. My favourite call ran something like this:<br>
        ME: What's the problem? THEM: The sever's down! ME: Are you sure it's plugged in? THEM: Yes, all the cables are plugged in but the lights aren't on.
        ME: Have you tried pressing the power button? THEM: Hold on... Yes, it's still not coming on. ME: Hmmm... THEM: Er, we've had a leak and the server's
        sitting in a pool of water, do you think that might have something to do with it? ME: We probably shouldn't rule that out.
