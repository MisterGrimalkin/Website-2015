        <h1>Monosystems (1998 - 2000)</h1>

        <p>
            Monosystems was an interior fit-out and joinery company in Birmingham. I worked there as 'Technical Assistant' in between
            completing my A-levels and starting university. My responsibilities included setting up and managing the
            IT infrastructure and building several bespoke Visual Basic applications for project estimation and administration.
            I had built computers and written databases while I was at school, but this was my first experience of managing a
            network and dealing with users.
        </p>
        <p>
            I stayed on to provide technical support after I started my degree in 1999. My favourite call ran something like this:
            <br>ME: What's the problem?
            <br>THEM: The sever's down!
            <br>ME: Are you sure it's plugged in?
            <br>THEM: Yes, all the cables are plugged in but the lights aren't on.
            <br>ME: Have you tried pressing the power button?
            <br>THEM: Hold on... yes, and it's still not coming on.
            <br>ME: Hmmm...
            <br>THEM: Er, we've had a leak and the server's sitting in a pool of water, do you think that might have something to do with it?
            <br>ME: We probably shouldn't rule that out.
        </p>
