    I'm a piano/keys player and recording engineer with many years experience with all sorts of musical projects.
    I ran a music studio in Birmingham for eight years before moving to London in 2010.
    I am available for session work, live or studio, and I'm always interested in working
    with interesting musicians. You can find me on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mistergrimalkin">SoundCloud</a>
    and <a href="http://www.bandmix.co.uk/mister-grimalkin/">BandMix</a>.
