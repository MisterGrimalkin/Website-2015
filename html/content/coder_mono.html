<h1>Monosystems (1998 - 2000)</h1>

<p>
    Monosystems was an interior fit-out and joinery company in Birmingham. I worked there as 'Technical Assistant' in between
    completing my A-levels and starting university. My responsibilities included setting up and managing the
    IT infrastructure and building several bespoke Visual Basic applications for project estimation and administration.
    I had built computers and written databases while I was at school, but this was my first experience of managing a
    network and dealing with users.

    I stayed on to provide technical support after I started my degree in 1999. My favourite call ran something like this:
    <br>ME: What's the problem?
    <br>THEM: The sever's down!
    <br>ME: Are you sure it's plugged in?
    <br>THEM: Yes, all the cables are plugged in but the lights aren't on.
    <br>ME: Have you tried pressing the power button?
    <br>THEM: Hold on... yes, and it's still not coming on.
    <br>ME: Hmmm...
    <br>THEM: Er, we've had a leak and the server's sitting in a pool of water, do you think that might have something to do with it?
    <br>ME: We probably shouldn't rule that out.
