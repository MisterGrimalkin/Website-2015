<h1>Current Projects</h1>

<p>
    I am currently taking a sabbatical from day-job world to give myself time to focus on
    music and other projects. I'm writing and recording my own music, which I will gradually
    release into the wild when I'm happy with it.
</p>
<p>
    I recently played on a three-track EP for singer/songwriter
    <a href="http://www.lewisforemanmusic.co.uk/">Lewis Foreman</a>
    and will be playing in his live band to support the release.
</p>
<p>
    I'm playing with singer/songwriter <a href="https://soundcloud.com/angie-music">Angie Porter</a>
    on her live project.
</p>
<p>
    I played with jazz/soul band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soulmaze">Soulmaze</a> at several London festivals
    over the summer, and in a live studio session at the London School of Sound earlier in the year. I will be playing with them
    again in 2016.
</p>
<p>
    I frequently gig with Midlands-based jazz/funk/psychedelic band <a href="https://soundcloud.com/snootybobs">Snooty Bobs</a>.
<p>
<p>
    I still play with ska/punk covers super-group extraordinaire
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lessthanareelbiggoldfishfinger">Less Than A Real Big Gold Fish Finger</a>,
    which was put together for a one-off, never-to-be-repeated show at an event in Portugal in 2013. We played our seventh
    and eighth gigs in December, and have more planned for 2016.
