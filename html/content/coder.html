    I'm a Computer Science graduate from Warwick University. I have five years
    professional experience as a software engineer, and previously wrote bespoke software for my own
    business. I created an interactive audio-visual installation and a digital display system
    for Greenpeace at the Glastonbury Festival 2015.
