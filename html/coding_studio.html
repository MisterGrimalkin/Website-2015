    <h1>Hockley Street Studios (2002 - 2010)</h1>

    <p>
        I was a partner in this small music business and co-ran it for many years. I was involved with the raising of the initial capital, physically (very
        physically) involved with the interior fit-out of the four-floor premises, and had responsibility for managing the company's finances. I gained
        enormous experience of customer relations, with a customer base that spanned a swathe of demographics and musical backgrounds. I've become quite skilled
        at adapting my spoken and written language to suit my target audience, and I'm well good at chatting with all sorts of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote a bespoke Visual Basic application to manage the operational aspects of the business, which is still in use.
        I designed all promotional material used during my time there.
        I liaised with the local council, magazines, radio stations and other bodies.

        Following the refit of our recording studio in 2006 I became the resident producer and session keyboardist, and worked with a great many local
        bands and artists from a range of musical styles. I worked effectively with experienced bands and complete novices. I worked mainly in Cubase, but have
        since switched platforms and now use Logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        I left the business when I moved to London to pursue other interests.
