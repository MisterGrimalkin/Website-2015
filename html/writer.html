        <h1>This Page</h1>

        <p>
            For years I've written stories in my spare time, usually some form of science fiction.
            Following a positive response to some stories I've posted online recently I've
            begun trying to sell stories to magazines. Since I'm currently offering publishing rights
            on my stories I can't post any fiction content here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can link to one piece of non-fiction I wrote a few months ago, detailing a technical project I did for the Glastonbury Festival 2015.
            You can find it <a href="http://showmethespoon.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/leap-and-net-will-appear.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page is primarily here to demonstrate to myself that I'm serious about doing this. But if you happen to have
            stumbled across it, thanks for reading :)
