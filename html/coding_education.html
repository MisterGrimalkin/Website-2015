    <p>
        I received a BSc. in Computer Science (2:1) from the University of Warwick. My final year project was a Java implementation of Dijkstra's Guarded
        Command Language, to produce mathematically-verifiable Java algorithms using Weakest Precondition.
    </p>
    <p>
        I attended Handsworth Grammar School for A-Levels in: Computing (A), Maths (A), Physics (A), General Studies (A), Further Maths (B)
        and a Special Paper in Physics (2); and GCSEs in: Maths (A*), English (A*), English Literature (A*), French (A*), Physics (A*), Chemistry (A*),
        Biology (A), Information Technology (A), Geography (A) and Music (B).

        During my GCSEs I did a two-week work experience with a development team at ICL, where I first learned SQL and caffeine abuse.

    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a bewilderingly TLA-heavy list of some of the technologies I have experience with: GXT, GWT, BootStrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for UIs;
        Guice, Gin and Spring for dependency management and AOP;
        Maven, Ant and Bash for building and deployment; Hibernate, Toad and PL/SQL for database work; Jersey for HTTP services; JUnit and Cobertura for unit and
        behavioral tests;
        servers including Tomcat and GlassFish; Amazon Cloud Services; Akka for scalability; Git, Mercurial and Subversion for code versioning; JMS, XML and JSON.
        I am a very fast learner when it comes to new technologies, because I had to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am proficient with PhotoShop and Excel. I've used NetBeans and Eclipse IDEs but more recently settled on IntelliJ IDEA.
        I prefer Linux and Android for everyday use, Mac OS-X for music production and Windows when I absolutely have to.
