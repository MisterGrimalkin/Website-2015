        <h1>Education</h1>

        <p>
            I received a BSc. in Computer Science (2:1) from the University of Warwick. My final year project was a Java implementation
            of Dijkstra's Guarded Command Language, to produce mathematically-verifiable Java algorithms using Weakest Precondition.
        </p>

            I attended Handsworth Grammar School for A-Levels in: Computing (A), Maths (A), Physics (A), General Studies (A), Further Maths (B)
            and a Special Paper in Physics (2); and GCSEs in: Maths (A*), English (A*), English Literature (A*), French (A*), Physics (A*), Chemistry (A*),
            Biology (A), Information Technology (A), Geography (A) and Music (B).

            During my GCSEs I did a two-week work experience with a development team at ICL, where I first learned SQL and caffeine abuse.
